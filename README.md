# AOS_Project
#### The project was to build a distributed system using web services. This includes 2 main working principles - service discovery and load balancing. The web services namely Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division were created, accessed and invoked in this distributed infrastructure using client - server approach. SOAP protocol was implemented to send service requests to the particular web service designated servers from the client and then, the response was sent to the client.
